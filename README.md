Mixed reality with [Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/de/quest/quest-3/).

## This project

This is a very basic sample project to get started with Quest 3 development. It is based on the "Universal 3D" Unity template and contains the Meta XR All in One SDK and the MX Ink Samples. It can also be recreated from scratch by adding these components following the instructions linked below.

## Unity
Game Engine: [Unity](https://unity.com/)

### Installation
- If not installed already, install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub)
- Install Unity 6000.0.36 with _Android Support_ (including JDK/SDK/NDK)

## Meta XR All In One SDK
Meta SDK for Unity. Install it to get all the tools needed for development.

## Oculus Link 
For live preview on the headset, directly from the Unity Editor. 

**!! Windows only !!** (on Mac, use _Meta XR Simulator_ below)  

Instructions: https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-link


## Meta XR Simulator
For simulating the headset and controllers directly in the Unity Editor. No headset is required when controlling with mouse and keyboard. If you want to use the real controllers for testing, you need to connect a headset and run the "Meta XR Simulator - Data Forwarding Server" app on the headset. See instructions for details.
